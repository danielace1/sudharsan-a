## Pull Requests
Here are some guidelines to make the process smoother:

- **Add a test** - new features and bug fixes should include test coverage. If you find it difficult to test a change, mention it in the pull request.
- **Document any change in behavior** - ensure `README.md` and related documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Run `npm test` locally** - this helps you move faster and allows maintainers to review quicker.
- **One pull request per feature** - if you plan multiple improvements, split them into separate PRs to keep reviews focused and organized.
- **Send coherent history** - write meaningful commit messages (`Add:`, `Fix:`, `Improve:`) that clearly describe your changes.
- **No changes without discussion** - avoid introducing behavior that alters the direction of a section or interaction unless it has been discussed and approved through an issue.

## Creating Issues

### Bug Reports
When reporting a bug, always try to provide as much information as possible. Include at minimum:

- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or error logs (if available)
- A stack trace or reproduction link (if possible)

This helps us verify and resolve the problem faster.

### Feature Requests
When proposing a new idea, lay out the reasoning behind it and describe the expected outcome. Ideally include:

- The motivation behind the request
- Suggested behavior or UI/interaction improvement
- A practical example, mockup, or reference that proves its value

Productive suggestions that enhance clarity, interaction, or responsiveness are highly encouraged.
